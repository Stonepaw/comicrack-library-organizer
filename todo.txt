change template to use the actually property instead of a weird name

change exclude rules to use negation button instead of extra combobox items
change exclude rules manga to use "is Yes" with only one combo box. Will be easier to code the changes between types. Will require changing code in loading profile.


FIX LOCALIZER: Specifically the translated fields. They don't need to be translated when the script normally runs. Just when the gui runs.


IMPORTANT: Change the template items class to automatically get the translation instead of calling it in the args








Exclude rules from ComicRack looks complicated. Continue using the method I'm using but expand the operators. "Matches" has the translations of the operators.


fields still to do:
conditional

illegal characters use commands to grey out remove button and add buttons.

fields to add:
Day, Released Date, AddedDate, EndYear, EndMonth

add date field to rules

Overhaul getting property values with:
	print books[0].GetStringPropertyValue("Series", ComicValueType.Shadow) #Gets the value and if failing, getting the shadowvalues
        print books[0].GetPropertyValue[str]("BlackAndWhite", True)


group yesno stuff together in wrap panel.

group multiple value stuff together in wrap panel

possibly field to visiblity converter.

yes/no add selector for yes/no/unkown/yes right to left

All better error catching in all places where files are moved/modifed etc.

add user text to if and then for conditionals

tracking for moving fielless images

remember to show in release notes changes for the if/not
