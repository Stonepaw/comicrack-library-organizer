possibly use dictonary key value pairs for combobox options in options page

move items to single pages. Possible with expanders


change template to use the actualy property instead of a wierd name

change exclude rules to use negation button instead of extra combobox items
change exclude rules manga to use "is Yes" with only one combo box. Will be easier to code the changes between types. Will require changing code in loading profile.

Exclude rules from ComicRack looks complicated. Continue using the method I'm using but expand the operators. "Matches" has the translations of the operators.


fields still to do:
conditional


Overhaul getting property values with:
	print books[0].GetStringPropertyValue("Series", ComicValueType.Shadow) #Gets the value and if failing, getting the shadowvalues
        print books[0].GetPropertyValue[str]("BlackAndWhite", True)


group yesno stuff together in wrap panel.

group multiple value stuff together in wrap panel

possibly field to visiblity converter.

yes/no add selector for yes/no/unkown/yes right to left

All better error catching in all places where files are moved/modifed etc.

add user text to if and then for conditionals
