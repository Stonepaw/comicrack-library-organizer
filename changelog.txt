2.1.12
BUG: Fixed not finding duplicates if file path had different capitalizations
BUG: Wrong version in configuration window
BUG: SelectedIndex out of range error when no custom value defined in the library
BUG: Various errors where text in the final report may not be reported correctly
Bug: Improved error handling in all moving code. This should cause a lot less errors in some cases.

CHANGE: Improved copying existing fields when in copy mode. More fields are copied, including custom fields?
CHANGE: Duplicates window has been overhauled to work more efficiently and show more information when the book isn't in the library
Change: No longer copies a file multiple times when it can be used under several profiles. Just the last one is used.
Change: Implemented better logging for most parts of the process. Logs are stored under %appdata%/cYo/ComicRack/Library Organizer/logs/

New: Option to count different extensions as duplicates
New: Duplicates window is now translatable (other windows to come)


TODO: Add tag or custom value after successful move.
TODO: Undo move using custom value to store previous path. Add right click menu support. Keep undo last move script?
