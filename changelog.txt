New: Added inversion feature. Syntax is {<!fieldname>}. This will insert the prefix and suffix when the value of the field is empty.

Change: Empty replacements now don't insert the prefix and suffix of the field.

Bugfix:
Fix for index out of range: 0 when running the configure script on an empty library. (Previews will be disabled)
Attempted fix for error when clicking insert buttons (never could reproduce this so I'm not sure if I fixed it or not)
Previews now show & characters
