Added multivalue fields: Penciller, Inker, Colorist, Letterer, Cover Artist, Editor and Locations.
Function to export all the profiles to a single file.
Added a way to run several profiles in sequence.
Option to mark operations with specific empty data as failed. Can also move these to a different failed folder.
Option when overwriting a book to copy the read percentage of the old book to the new one.


Changes:
Much code has been rewriten with many little tweaks and fixes.
Any field can be put in the prefix or suffix of any other field
