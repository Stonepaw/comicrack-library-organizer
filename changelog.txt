New: Added conditional feature. Syntax is {<?fieldname(Match text)>}. This will insert the prefix and suffix when the value of the match text matches the field.
Note you can use regular expresions with the match text by using (!regular expression).

Bugfix:
Fixed a bug where exclude group rules where duplicated.
