BUG: Fixed not finding duplicates if file path had different capitalizations
BUG: Wrong version in configuration window
BUG: SelectedIndex out of range error when no custom value defined in the library
BUG: No longer copies multiplies times when a book can be copied under multiple profiles?????? Might have been intentional

CHANGE: Improved copying existing fields when in copy mode. More fields are copied, inlcuding custom fields?
CHANGE: Duplicates window has been changed to reflect better information when the book isn't in the library
