The inspiration for this script comes from wadegiles's Guided eComic file renaming and some code is based on that script.
Thanks to him for creating it in the first place.
That script can be found at: http://comicrack.cyolito.com/user-forum/13-scripts/807-guided-ecomic-file-renaming-full-gui

Thanks to pescuma for the fix in duplicate naming.

The icons in the configure dialog are from an icon set called WooFunction
